Welcome! Congrats on finding this and congrats on officership! This text file is here to guide you through the directories here and your duties as webmaster.

PREVIEWING SITE CHANGES

This site does not use any server-side languages which means it can be run locally on your own computer. To do this, download contents of the directory public_html to your computer. Click on an HTML file (e.g. index.html) and it should open in your default web browser.

UPDATING OFFICERS

At the beginning of each year, you will want to update public_html/officers.html with new officers. Follow the steps below retain past records. In general, deleting information is strongly discouraged!
1. Duplicate officers.html and rename it to "officers-PREVIOUS_YEAR.html" (e.g. "officers-2018.html")
2. For your newly renamed file: Remove or comment out the "Past Officers" section at the bottom, update page title to "Past Officers YEAR" (e.g. "Past Officers 2018").
3. Add a link to your newly renamed file on the officers.html file under "Past Officers" following previous years as examples.
4. Use your new officers' info to replace entries in officers.html.
5. Put officer photos in public_html/src/img/officers. Avoid overwriting existing images.

UPDATING EVENTS

Throughout the year you will be updating the site with upcoming events. The homepage (public_html/index.html) and the events page (public_html/events.html) reference a Javascript file (public_html/src/js/main.js) to automatically load upcoming events. If events are added correctly (using the template on main.js and following previous years as examples), events will automatically load to pages in the correct sections (they will load in past events once the date has passed, or will load in volunteer events if it is upcoming and has been tagged as a volunteer event, etc.) The past events section of events.html displays events from the past year (the past 365 days), but again it is good practice to avoid deleting information in main.js. Having a record of past events is good for future leadership teams in their planning of events.

If you open public_html/index.html or public_html/events.html and see no events appear, it means you've mistyped something in main.js. Go back and look for unpaired brackets, unpaired quotation marks, or missing commas.

CERTIFICATES

You're responsible for preparing the template for certificates at the end of each quarter. The template is in unpublished/certificate.pptx. Preparing this template is as easy as updating the year (e.g. from 2017 to 2018). Note for everything to appear correct, you'll need to install the free font Roboto on your computer, located in unpublished/roboto.zip.

BRANDING

It looks best when an organization has a consistent appearance on social media and on paper. This organization uses Roboto as its font, #9aabcb (lavender) and #f2f2f2 (light grey) as its primary and secondary colors, and #000000 (black) and #ffffff (white) as its text colors.

BACK UPS

It's good practice to keep backups of the site somewhere on your computer in case something goes wrong. As a last resort, if everything goes missing George (gmsun@uw.edu) has a backup that was last updated August 18, 2017.

FURTHER CHANGES

Feel free to make additional improvements to the site, scrap it entirely with a new version, etc. Whatever you do, be sure to document it well so future generations can understand your work.
