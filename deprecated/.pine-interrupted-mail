Hi Grace,
I thought I should let you know that the price of the Kaplan DAT
course is scheduled to increase by $100 on May 3rd.  Since your
members already get the $100 discount, if they sign up soon they
basically save $200.  So if you know anyone who is planning on taking
a course soon feel free to give them a heads up.

Have a great day!
Meredith
