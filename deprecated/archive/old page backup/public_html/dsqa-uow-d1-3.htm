of Washington - D1, Class of 2005</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><u>1.&nbsp; What suggestions do you have to pre-dental students
getting ready for dental school?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>Volunteer at a clinic.&nbsp; The UW is a great place to
    do this, because there's a lot of clinics, and versus private practices,
    clinics generally allow the volunteers to have more responsibilities.&nbsp;
    Also, dentists in the UW clinics may be involved with teaching at the UW,
    and may care more about the advancement of your education.&nbsp; Also, it
    will provide you with a picture of what being a dentist is about.&nbsp;
    (It's nice to know what an amalgam, composite, endo, inlay, onlay, crown,
    etc are.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Try to get a job in a dental
    laboratory.&nbsp; Your first two years of Dental School will focus on lab
    work.&nbsp; If you can get good experience working at a lab, you will be
    miles ahead of most dental students. This was the most frustrating part of
    my first quarter, and is something I wish I had done.</i></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>2.&nbsp; Do you feel you have made the right decision on the
school you are attending?</u>&nbsp;</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>For me, yes.&nbsp; I like Seattle, and the UW.&nbsp; It
    should be known that the faculty here do not pat you on the back, or
    sugar-coat things. Generally, they're pretty nice, but they can also be
    pretty harsh.&nbsp; I've heard other schools are much kinder, but I like
    where I am, and my classmates.&nbsp; At UW, you're expected to learn a lot
    on your own; it's a different world from undergrad.</i></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; What are some strengths and weaknesses of the
school?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>This is tough to talk about, because I have nothing to
    compare it to.&nbsp; The school has a good reputation.&nbsp; The lab is
    supposed to be one of the best in the country.&nbsp; Weaknesses are also
    tough to describe, because I don't know what is important to me, and what is
    not.&nbsp; Right now, we have basic science classes which seem to involve
    details that aren't important to dentists (i.e.: what's palpable in a rectal
    exam?&nbsp; the development of the external genitalia?&nbsp;
    Bronchopulmonary segments?)&nbsp; I kind of wish the classes would involve
    what we need to know with more focus on the things we will use</i>.&nbsp;</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>4.&nbsp; How is the student/teacher ratio?&nbsp; What is your
impression of the&nbsp; faculty?&nbsp;</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>I appreciate the faculty, because they almost volunteer
    their time to our learning.&nbsp; They could be having more fun (like
    working and earning more money, golfing, spending more time with family),
    but they are there for us.&nbsp; Although they don't make dental school
    easy, without them we'd be lost.&nbsp; The ratio is okay, but you have to
    understand that there's a nation-wide shortage of faculty (and dentists).&nbsp;
    I think there is enough faculty available for help, but it's isn't always
    easy to find someone.&nbsp; I wouldn't say it's a major problem, though.</i></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>5.&nbsp; Do you get enough clinical experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>First quarter we got no clinical experience.&nbsp; That's
    why volunteering can be valuable.&nbsp; This quarter we will be spending
    some time in the emergency clinic, and looking at our classmates mouths.&nbsp;
    Right now, we don't have the skills to be in clinic, but we do have the
    opportunity to assist 3rd and 4th years.&nbsp; I haven't done that, because
    I think my volunteer experience would be close to the same thing.&nbsp; The
    faculty and dean understand that we'd like to be in clinic, but we don't
    have the skill.&nbsp; Clinic time will come, and the curriculum is trying to
    get us in their more than past years.</i>&nbsp;</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>6.&nbsp; How competitive is the class?&nbsp; Are classes with
medical students?</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>There's a handful of competitive people, but it's not
    like the med school where every student is trying to beat the others.&nbsp;
    There are classes with the med students, but the UW med school is
    pass/fail/honors, so there isn't a whole lot of pressure.</i></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p align="left"><u>7.&nbsp; How's city life and the weather?</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>I think most people know whether or not they like cities.&nbsp;
    So it's a personal choice.&nbsp; I've gotten use to the weather, so the rain
    doesn't bother me much.&nbsp; Also, last quarter I didn't have to worry
    about missing out on a nice sunny day, because I went to class before the
    sun had fully risen, spent all day inside, and left the health sciences
    building after dark.</i>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u>8.&nbsp; Additional comments</u></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>Dental school is a lot different from undergrad at UW;
    it's a different world.&nbsp; I took some hard quarters at UW, but they
    really don't compare.&nbsp; For example, in Spring 2000 I took Biology, O
    Chem, and Physics.&nbsp; It was hard, but I did well.&nbsp; Fall 2000 I took
    Bio-chem, Microbiology 402 &amp; 410, Social Psych, and Classics 205, and
    that wasn't nearly as bad as dental school (as far as the work to success
    ratio).&nbsp; However, your experience at dental school can be improved if
    you work at a lab and get good experience, and are able to manage your time
    well.&nbsp; Thanks for reading!</i>&nbsp;</p>
