of the Pacific&nbsp; - D1, Class of 2004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>

    <dt><u>1.&nbsp; What suggestions do you have to pre-dental students getting
      ready for dental school?</u></dt>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>In preparing for dental school I think it is important to
    take as many of the subjects that are on the National Boards (Part I) as
    possible.&nbsp; It will help you with the exam (probably taken your 2nd year
    of dental school) plus it will help with the classes you have to take during
    your 1st year.&nbsp; It will help because of the load you have the 1st year.
    Individually the classes are not incredibly difficult, but collectively it
    is hard to manage your time to do well in each course.&nbsp; The classes
    are: histology, biochemistry, gross anatomy (any anatomy classes will help),
    physiology, and microbiology. In addition, it would be VERY useful to have
    some sort of lab experience.&nbsp; It is important to volunteer in dental
    clinics and do as much assisting as possible, but it would also be helpful
    to work in a dental laboratory.&nbsp; At UOP, you do as much lab work
    (cavity preps, crown preps, crown model work and casting, etc.) as didactic
    work your 1st year, and the people that have lab experience definitely have
    an edge.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <div align="left">
    </div>
  <dt><u>2.&nbsp; Do you feel you have made the right decision on the school you
    are attending?&nbsp;</u>
  <div>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>UOP is the PERFECT environment to go through such a
    rigorous curriculum.&nbsp; The overall attitude of the building every single
    day is extremely positive.&nbsp; We are all part of a family, and everyone
    looks out for everyone else.&nbsp; I do not feel competition among the
    classes, which is rare in a program such as dental school.&nbsp; Pretty much
    any dental school you go to in the country, you will be a
    &quot;qualified&quot; dentist, but it is my strong belief that you should go
    to the school you feel the most comfortable regardless of the cost,
    location, reputation, etc.&nbsp; Your success as a student and inevitably as
    a professional will be best at a place you enjoy going to every day!!!&nbsp;
    That will be the best advice anyone can ever give you about picking a
    school.&nbsp; I have never thought twice about my decision to come to UOP!&nbsp;
    For the way I learn and for me to be the best student I can be, I feel this
    school is the best school in the country!&nbsp;</i></p>
    <div align="left">
    </div>
  <dt><u>3.&nbsp; What are some strengths and weaknesses of the school?&nbsp;</u>
  <div>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>It is the opinion of some (although not held by me) that
    one of the weaknesses of UOP is the three-year curriculum. They think that
    you get less of an education because of the one-year difference. However,
    instead of completing 12 quarters in four calendar years, we complete 12
    quarters in three calendar years by having a summer quarter that is full
    time. There are numerous strengths of UOP. Each year, the Admissions
    Committee surveys the incoming class to learn why they chose UOP. The
    &quot;Top Ten&quot; reasons have remained constant over the last several
    years. They are listed on the UOP website, but here they are:&nbsp;</i></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>&nbsp;10. Three-year program: The
ability to complete four academic years of instruction in just three calendar
years appeals to both recent graduates and second career students. Many note
that UOP's program enables them to enter general practice or begin specialty
education one year earlier than any other dental program.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>9. Strong clinical and practice
management emphasis: Nearly all first-year students indicate that the strong
clinical orientation of the school is a major factor in their decision to attend
UOP.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>8. Reputation of UOP for producing
excellent clinicians: Students report that recommendations made by dentists,
students, and pre-dental advisors significantly influenced their decision to
attend UOP.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>7. Humanistic orientation: Students
note that faculty treat them as peers starting on the first day of school. UOP
places much emphasis on the development of self-confidence and self-esteem.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>6. Superb facility: Students like
the physical facility, which they describe as state-of-the-art, attractive, and
&quot;clean.&quot; UOP's new simulation lab sets the worldwide standard for
preclinical education. Students rank UOP's facility and environment above other
dental schools.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>5. Location: San Francisco is one
of the most unique and beautiful cities in the world. UOP's location in Pacific
Heights is considered to be a major advantage, particularly as a place to live
while in dental school.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>4. Quality of administration,
faculty, and staff: Applicants are impressed by faculty availability and the
quality of instruction. Also, many reported being impressed by their contact
with Dean Dugoni and administrators as well as staff who are praised
consistently for being friendly, helpful, and supportive.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>3. Curriculum: Students like the
integration of basic and clinical sciences that defines the UOP curriculum. They
also prefer the early clinical experience which starts on the first day of
school.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>2. Emphasis on competencies:
Students prefer UOP's competency-based instruction and evaluation system.
Competency-based evaluation is designed to measure the full range of knowledge,
skills, and professional values necessary to begin the independent practice of
dentistry.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px" align="left"><i>1. &quot;UOP family&quot;: Students
become part of the UOP family on the first day of school. They like the
interaction with UOP alumni and being treated as a peer by all. Many students
report that dentists have told them that alumni stay involved with the school
throughout their professional careers. The collaborative, non-competitive
relationships of current dental students also appeal to applicants.&nbsp;</i></p>
<dl>
  <div align="left">
    <dt><u>4.&nbsp; How is the student/teacher ratio?&nbsp; What is your
      impression of the faculty?&nbsp;</u></dt>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>The student faculty ratio is 11:1 in lab classes. (We are
    separated into rows in the simulation laboratory, and each row has a row
    instructor.) In other didactic classes, the ratio varies, but there is
    always plenty of help offered whenever it is needed. The faculty treat you
    as a colleague at UOP. That is part of the &quot;humanistic&quot;
    environment. The criticism is ALWAYS constructive and never demeaning. They
    are so willing to help you at all times! There are row instructors that stay
    after school or come in on a weekend to help students. They also will give
    up their lunches to help you understand a concept you are missing! They are
    truly there to help you to learn!&nbsp;</i></p>
    <div align="left">
    </div>
  <dt><u>5.&nbsp; Do you get enough clinical experience?&nbsp;</u>
  <div>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>The emphasis at UOP is clinical dentistry. This is
    demonstrated by how quickly you are practicing clinical dentistry. In my
    first week at this school, we were cutting cavity preparations with
    handpieces in my operative dentistry class. We were also practicing an
    anterior PFM crown in my restorative dentistry class. Most schools do not
    even see a high-speed handpiece until their second year. (Which again proves
    that we get just as much experience as four year programs…1 year of
    pre-clinical dentistry and 2 years of clinical dentistry practice.) Our
    clinic experience also starts early (the first quarter of your 2nd year). By
    the end of your 2nd year, you have already done crowns, bridges, endodontic
    therapy, and periodontic surgeries.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <div align="left">
    </div>
  <dt><u>6.&nbsp; How competitive is the class?&nbsp; Are classes with medical
    students?&nbsp;</u>
  <div>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>As I said before, there is very little competition within
    any class at UOP. Everyone is there to help everyone else. Test files are
    passed down from class to class, lecture notes are transcribed and posted
    for the entire class after difficult lectures, and tutors are available for
    people struggling in any given class. There are no medical students in any
    of our classes.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <div align="left">
    </div>
  <dt><u>7.&nbsp; How's city life and the weather?&nbsp;</u>
  <div>
  </div>
  <dd>
    <p align="left"><i>Living in San Francisco is wonderful! It actually reminds
    me a lot of&nbsp; Seattle, just much bigger!! Overall, the weather is
    comfortable;&nbsp;&nbsp;although, it is not like typical California weather.
    It is much cooler than many of the other neighboring cities. But it rarely
    rains and is often in the 60’s (even in January!). The really cool part
    about living in California is that you can drive in any direction and see
    different things. The beaches, wine country, Monterey and Carmel,&nbsp;
    Great America, Lake Tahoe, even Los Angeles are all within driving&nbsp;
    range.</i></p>
