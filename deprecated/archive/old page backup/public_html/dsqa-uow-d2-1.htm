<p align="left"><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080" size="4"><b>University
of Washington - D2, Class of 2004</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><u>1.&nbsp; What suggestions do you have to pre-dental students
getting ready for dental school?</u>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>If you're out of school already, get a dental-related job,
  like being an assistant (some dentists will let you do that,) or
  working/volunteering at a dental lab.&nbsp; If you're still in school, try to
  fit in some volunteer time at a dental clinic or a dental lab.&nbsp; Working
  at a dental lab will give you a leg up on learning things that you will
  eventually have to learn in dental school your first and second years,
  depending on what the lab will have you do.</i>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>2.&nbsp; Do you feel you have made the right decision on the
school you are attending?</u>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>Definitely.&nbsp; Although there are times when I wonder if
  it's this tough at other schools, and if the instructors are as scrutinous at
  other schools, I know that I made the right choice of going to the UW SOD b/c
  it's got such a good reputation, and for me, I wanted to stay close to home.&nbsp;
  Not to mention, you save about $100,000 by staying in-state rather than going
  out of state.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>3.&nbsp; What are some strengths and weaknesses of the
school?</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>Some of the faculty at the UW are world-renowned
  researchers/scientists in their field, but on the flip side, theyr'e also some
  of the worst teachers I've had at the University level.&nbsp; I'd say the
  majority of them are pretty good, if not great, but there are a few that
  expect you to learn things almost completely on your own, or don't put in a
  whole lot of effort to treat you like a decent human being.&nbsp; But the
  class size is definitely a strength at the UW; with a class size of 53, you
  can get to know people better than if you were in larger class.&nbsp; The
  facilities are good, although I can't really make any comparisons to other
  schools with simulators.&nbsp; (The only other school with a simulation lab
  that I've personally seen is Pacific).&nbsp; And the department staff is
  pretty friendly and supportive.&nbsp; As far as the curriculum, I think it's
  pretty good, but like the simulation lab, I don't have much to compare it
  with.&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>4.&nbsp; How is the student/teacher ratio?&nbsp; What is your
impression of the faculty?</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>Student to teacher ratio is good; with a pretty constant
  class size of 53, it's much better than when I was an undergrad at the UW.&nbsp;
  I guess it's all relative; for anyone that went to small private school for
  college, it's not going to be so good.&nbsp; For those of us that went to
  large public universities like the UW, it seems great.&nbsp; Most classes are
  made just for dental students, with the exception of gross anatomy (shared
  with med students), head and neck anatomy (shared with med students,) and
  physiology (shared with nursing students).&nbsp; These shared classes are all
  in the first year; after that, it's just you and your fellow dental students.&nbsp;
  My impression of the faculty can be found in question 3.</i>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>5.&nbsp; Do you get enough clinical experience?</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>I'd say we're not getting much right now in our 2nd quarter
  of our 2nd year, but I'm also glad, because I don't feel I'm ready to do much
  clinical stuff yet.&nbsp; But that will all change once the 3rd year rolls
  around, when it's almost all clinical.&nbsp; So right now, there's not much
  clinical stuff, but later on there's going to be more than enough.&nbsp; (I
  think)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>6.&nbsp; How competitive is the class?&nbsp; Are classes with
medical students?</u>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>Like I said in question 4, 2 of your classes the first year
  (gross anatomy, head and neck anatomy) are shared with med students, and 1
  (physiology) is shared with nursing students.&nbsp; I'd say a lot of people in
  our class are competitive, but not cut-throat competitive.&nbsp; You can tell
  that they want to do their very best and maybe go on to specialize, but they
  will still take the time to help you out if you have a question, or will share
  info to help on a test.&nbsp; I don't know about the classes above or below
  me, but I'd say our class is pretty good as far as competitiveness.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><u>7.&nbsp; How's city life and the weather?</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i>City life is great, I think; I don't have much time to go
  out and experience it.&nbsp; Just too much to do in too little time.&nbsp; But
  I guess that depends on the person; if you're someone who can study little yet
  still do well or do well enough to pass, than you can experience go out and
  experience city life.&nbsp; But if you're like me and you have to work hard
  and put in the time to pass your classes, then you're not going to see much
  outside of school and where you live.&nbsp; The weather?&nbsp; It's Seattle;
  the reputation says it all.</i></p>
