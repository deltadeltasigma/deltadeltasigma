      students getting ready for dental school?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p>

        <dd>
          <p align="left"><i>Don't worry! like the old saying goes just do your
          best and don't worry about the results. Get your test scores in, your
          application and recommendations in early!&nbsp;&nbsp; aim for a 3.5
          GPA and a 20 on your DAT and you're good to go! with that u have an
          awesome chance of getting&nbsp; into any dental school.&nbsp; Dental
          school is not as hard to get into as people make it out to be..... if
          U want to be a dentist...U will be one! Make sure you take all the
          pre-dental classes, if u don't care about a degree just take these
          classes. You don't need to take anything else, they don't care if you
          have a degree or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if u haven't taken the
          DAT yet take just take general chemistry, biology, and organic
          chemistry and as soon as u take these classes take the test, u should
          take Kaplan... it helps a LOT.&nbsp; these r the only science subjects
          on the test, so its all u have to know.&nbsp; The application process
          is a headache. At&nbsp; most... pick 10 never more schools because
          traveling, interviewing, and keeping track of them all sucks. The
          interview is nothing.. they just go over what u wrote on your
          application and ask u to tell them about the things u wrote. they ask
          also why u want to be a dentist and why u want to go to their school.
          they never asked me about my weaknesses or any tough questions or
          questions about the actual profession of dentistry.&nbsp;</i></p>

          medical doctors do... why do I have to learn about the ovaries? if u
          come here.... you'll be educated as a medical doctor. Of course you'll
          learn everything about clinical dentistry too. Weaknesses:&nbsp; Your

          are walking around you. The some of the faculty are nice, but some are
          ok; you don't do most of your learning from them, its the other people
