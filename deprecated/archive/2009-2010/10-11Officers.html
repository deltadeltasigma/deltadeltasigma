	<h3>Co-President: Keiana Hadjireza</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Biochemistry  <br>

	   	<b>Unique travel experience: </b>
		 I was very excited when I was chosen to join the GDB trip to Honduras because I had 
		 never been to a third world country, nor Central America. I enjoyed every minute 
		 of that trip from helping educate thousands of native Hondurans about dental hygiene to dealing with large insects and bathing in bug spray. The country of Honduras will always have a special place in my heart because of the rich culture I was able to experience. The scenery was breathtaking, the people were so kind, so happy, and the food was phenomenal! This trip hands down was my most unique experience because it wasn't for leisurely purposes but rather a humbling experience that helped change my views about the things I take for granted and how dentistry will help me to help others in need. 
		 
		 <br /><b>Unique experience that shaped my interest in Dentistry: </b>
		  My trip to Honduras definitely helped me see things in perspective about dentistry because it only made me more passionate about becoming a dentist and helping to donate my time to volunteering and helping people who do not have access to dentists. Honduras was not the only experience that helped shape my interest, in order to make sure dentistry is the career for me I felt that volunteering in the community was important as well. I started volunteering with ECOH and going to different health fairs and promoting dental hygiene to children and adults. This made me more aware of the education that is still lacking amongst the community. I truly enjoy helping people become aware of the proper ways to take care of their teeth because oral health begins with education which leads to better dental habits.

	<h3>Co-President: Caitlin Flynn</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b>  Physiology with minor in Diversity<br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> June 2012<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b>  I want to go into dentistry because it gives me a chance to work in healthcare and develop and maintain
		 long-term relationships with patients. Dentistry also gives you the ability to use problem solving skills on a daily basis. 
		And I love teeth!  <br>

		<b>Favorite experience regarding dentistry?</b>  My favorite experience in dentistry was probably while working in the DECOD 
		clinic at the UW. One day in particular I was observing a patient which suffered severe disabilities and could not communicate with 
		the dental staff. Later, I asked the doctor how he was able to come everyday and work with patients who become distraught or are unable 
		to communicate. The doctor showed me a small photograph of the patient from earlier as a child. Seeing the joy on the patient's face in 
		that photograph answered my question. Being a dentist means helping people, in the DECOD clinic it means helping people other dentists 
		refuse to see, and that makes a difference in these patients lives. <br>

		<b>Area of specialty?</b>  I hope to go into Pediatric Dentistry or Orthodontics because both give me a chance to work with a younger 
		demographic and encourage early childhood oral health.  <br> 
		<b>Unique travel experience: </b> My unique experience is not necessarily the common experience of going to exotic locations and partaking in exciting activities. Rather I will tell a funny anecdote of one of the many disastrous and funny travels my Mother and I have taken. Lets begin with the truly awful sense of direction my Mother has and the Orlando freeway system. So here we are trying to go to one of the many outlet malls in Orlando in 2009. Orlando has had the fabulous idea to have sparsely dispersed exits, little signage, and exits, which lead you onto turnpikes or toll roads. If you don’t know where this is going I will clue you in: we got hopelessly lost across 4 miles of freeway for TWO HOURS. Eventually when we would get to tolls we were digging out coins from every crevice of our purses (we find out later rental cars don’t pay tolls…). Finally we found a place to park and laughed hysterically (and by this I mean fairly manically at our incompetence at navigating a seemingly simple stretch of highway). We never quite managed to get off the freeway at the right time throughout our entire stay. If you are interested to hear about my Dad's fear of Mexican Policia, me running full speed in a walking cast in the Atlanta airport, or any other of my travel mishaps I will happily relate them to you!
		<b>Random Fact?</b>  I have never met anyone remotely famous.<br>

	<h3>Volunteer Coordinator: Karta Shaffer-Thigpen</h3>

		<b>Major: </b> post-baccalaureate with a B.M. in Music Performance and an A.A.S. in dental hygiene.<br />
		<b>Hometown or place of birth: </b>Ketchikan, Alaska<br />
		<b>Unique travel experience:</b>The most memorable experience I've had on my travels is when I drove solo from Ellensburg, WA to Prince Rupert, BC.  The drive takes about 22 hours and I drove almost all of it in the first day.  After 12 hours of driving north (and listening to the same book on tape twice) the only thing that kept me awake was the Aurora Borealis.  It was a dark highway and I was one of a few cars on the road.  It was just me and the northern lights.  Beautiful. <br />
		<b>At what age did you know dentistry was right for you?</b>
		At the age of twelve I was chair-side assisting for my father during weekend emergencies; however, it wasn't until a few years ago that I decided to pursue dental school.<br />

	<h3>Activities: Chen-Yu Ma</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major:</b> Biochemistry & Public Health<br>

	   	<b>Hometown:</b> Keelung, Taiwan<br />

		<b>Unique Travel Experience: </b>
		Having the opportunity of traveling to Taiwan this summer for a month, I worked as an English teacher at a local elementary school in Hsin-Chu County (high up in the mountains!) where all the attending students were native minorities. Throughout time there, I was able to expand the knowledge of my native land and also share my experience and understanding of American cultures and education respectively to the locals. 
				
		<br />
		<b>What is one of my unique experiences that shape my interest in dentistry?</b>
		Standing a few inches away from the surgical chair along with attending nurse, dental assistant, and oral surgeon, I was watching two hands performing a miraculous procedure on a young woman who has long lost her light of confidence and hope in life. Once again, with an enormous fear towards any kind of dental treatment since her childhood, this young woman yet decided to sit on the chair hoping not to run away as she did last several times due to her severe situation. With long patience from the clinicians and strong determination from her, this sweat-losing surgery lasted about two hours. The moment when the oral surgeon took off his surgical mask and the brave young woman looked at her new appearance through the mirror, joyful tears filled the surgical room not just from her but also from the rest of surgical team. “I look great now…It has been years since last time I saw myself publicly acceptable…” A life was renewed in this room.  <br />

	<h3>Webmaster: Dan Shaw</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major:</b> B.S. Information Systems<br>

	   	
		<b>Interests & hobbies: </b>
		Playing soccer and volleyball, and spending time with my wife and son.
		<br />
		
		
		<b>Unique Travel Experience: </b>
		Spending two years living in Brazil as a missionary for the LDS church. In addition to strengthening my religious beliefs, the experience taught me to be independent, work hard, and to be outgoing. It also helped me learn how to deal with people of all different backgrounds, and gave me a desire to serve those less fortunate than myself.
