	<h3>President: Keiana</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Biochemistry  <br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> June 2009<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b>  There are multiple reasons why I picked dentistry among everything else.  It is
		an artistic field that allows you to work with your hands to help improve the health and appearance of
		patients.  Dentistry is filled with diversity; dentists get to interact with people of all ages, genders, 
		and cultures.  Also, it allows you to see the same patients over a lifetime and build a strong connection 
		with them.  Since I definitely want to get married and start a family someday, this field gives me the
		opportuntiy to open my own practice, allowing me to balance my personal and professional life.<br>

		<b>Unique experience in dentistry?</b>  Going on a dental mission to Honduras was definitely one of the most unique 
		experiences I have ever had. It was a great chance for me to step outside a conventional dental clinic and see the reality 
		of oral health disparities in third world countries. The lack of access to dental care was a major problem in Honduras. 
		Regular dental checkups were out of the question for these people, many of them had never seen a dentist before and did 
		not even own a toothbrush! Consequently their oral health conditions were beyond words. With no electricity and only basic 
		instruments, our dental team was able to treat 100-150 patients a day. It was very satisfying providing care for these people, 
		but at the same time it was unfortunate seeing them suffer from such highly preventable oral diseases. This was an eye-opening 
		experience that has motivated me even more to join this profession where I can actively contribute to the health and well-being 
		of people. <br>

		<b>Specialty in dentistry?</b>  Pediatric dentistry because I enjoy working with children and would love to be involved in 
   		helping people develop good dental habits at a young age directing them toward the path to a lifetime of good oral health.<br>

		<b>Random Fact</b> My name means peace and I was born on Oct. 2nd, International Day of Non-Violence (funny coincidence).<br>

	<h3>Vice President: Trusha Patel</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Biochemistry  <br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> March 2010  <br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b> For the longest time, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life helping people
		in the medicine area, but I was not sure specifically what to pursue.  However, after shadowing many 
		professions in the medical area, at the end of the day I missed being in the dental clinic the most.
		I am not the type of person who can sit in a cubical all day and work on the computer; I love meeting 
		and helping people.  Dentistry is the best profession for me because it integrates everything I love.  <br>

		<b>Who inspires you?</b> My parents and my brother inspire me the most, they have been through so 
		many hardships, and I respect them because they never gave up in their goals in life.  <br>

		<b>What interests do you have, other than dentistry?</b> I love to shop, eat Red Mango, watch Friends, 
		I'm pretty open to doing new things, as long as I spend it with my friends, then I will be happy. <br>

		<b>What's on your MP3 player?</b> A lot of random music.  I do not have a specific type of music I
		listen to, anything that sounds good to me I will put in my iPod. <br>

		<b>What is your favorite book?</b> "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" by J.K. Rowling.  <br>

		<b>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</b> In 10 years I see myself done with dental school, married,
		and working in my own practice.  However, I also want to travel to third world locations such as Africa 
		or Central America and do volunteer work.  Traveling to third world countries will give me the opportunity to
		provide oral healthcare to people across the world and give them hope. <br>

	<h3>Secretary: Allison Byun</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Public Health  <br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> Winter 2009<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b> I like working and interacting with people up close, and I also admire the close bond that 
		dentists and patients form.  Most of all, I love working with my hands.  I can't think of any career I would love more. <br>

		<b>Who inspires you?</b> My family. <br>

		<b>What interests do you have, other than dentistry?</b> Everything.  I love trying new things and am always open
		to learn and try different stuff.  I like cooking, playing tennis, and taking pictures. <br>

		<b>What's on your MP3 player?</b> Right now, Jack Johnson. <br>

		<b>What is your favorite book?</b> A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. <br>

		<b>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</b> I can see myself having my own clinic and having a family.  I would love to travel
		and volunteer at the same time and offer my service to those who are in need.  <br>

	<h3>Treasurer: Tracy Ngo</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology and Economics <br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> June 2010  <br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b> Growing up on the welfare system, I was still able to receive dental care through
		Medicaid and other government programs.  I was even able to get braces.  Both my pediatric dentist and
		orthodontist were great influences that inspired me to become a dentist.  Dentistry is such a unique 
		profession in that it combines science, art and business while being able to help others as a part of the
		health-care system.  It will also allow me to balance work and family.  I hope to open my own practice, help 
		those who aspire to be a part of the dental world and to give back to the community.<br>

		<b>Who inspires you?</b>  My mother.<br>

		<b>What interests do you have, other than dentistry?</b> Family, friends, dining out, movies, business
		and politics.<br>

		<b>What's on your MP3 player?</b>  A little bit of everything minus country.<br>

		<b>What is your favorite book?</b>  The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.   <br>

		<b>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</b>  I hope to be married with children and to have a successful
		practice.  Hopefully, I will also be able to give back to the community and help. <br>

	<h3>Activities Coordinator: Sarah Seanez</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b>  Microbiology, Medical Technology (dual degree)<br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> not known yet<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b>  I like seeing people happy and confident with them selves, and all is shown by their smile. It's a career where 
		I can help out those in need at something so easily neglected, like oral health.  <br>

		<b>Favorite experience regarding dentistry?</b>  Watching a cleft palate surgery. <br>

		<b>Area of specialty?</b>  Oral & Maxilofacial Surgery or Orthodontics  <br> 

		<b>Random Fact?</b>  Tech geek, I love Joss Whedon (can't help it).<br>

	<h3>Volunteer Coordinator: Dan Murphy </h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b> Post-bacc taking microbiology and biochem '08- '09  <br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> N/A   <br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b> It presents great opportunities for me to help solve problems and directly
		work with people every day. <br>

		<b>Favorite experience regarding Dentistry?</b> I've never before had a job as I do now where every day is truly unique. 
		It's the polar opposite of a short career I had as a courier where every day was exactly the same. Working for the Oral Surgery 
		Department, I wear a lot of hats and I am most successful when I bring people together to solve unexpected and one-of-a-kind problems. <br>

		<b>Random Fact?</b> I skipped fourth grade. My penmanship proves this. <br>

	<h3>Public Relations: Caitlyn Flynn</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b>  Physiology with minor in Diversity<br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> June 2012<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b>  I want to go into dentistry because it gives me a chance to work in healthcare and develop and maintain
		 long-term relationships with patients. Dentistry also gives you the ability to use problem solving skills on a daily basis. 
		And I love teeth!  <br>

		<b>Favorite experience regarding dentistry?</b>  My favorite experience in dentistry was probably while working in the DECOD 
		clinic at the UW. One day in particular I was observing a patient which suffered severe disabilities and could not communicate with 
		the dental staff. Later, I asked the doctor how he was able to come everyday and work with patients who become distraught or are unable 
		to communicate. The doctor showed me a small photograph of the patient from earlier as a child. Seeing the joy on the patient's face in 
		that photograph answered my question. Being a dentist means helping people, in the DECOD clinic it means helping people other dentists 
		refuse to see, and that makes a difference in these patients lives. <br>

		<b>Area of specialty?</b>  I hope to go into Pediatric Dentistry or Orthodontics because both give me a chance to work with a younger 
		demographic and encourage early childhood oral health.  <br> 

		<b>Random Fact?</b>  I have never met anyone remotely famous.<br>

	<h3>Webmaster: Keiana Hadjireza</h3>

	<p>	<b>Major(s):</b>  Biochemistry<br>

		<b>Intended Graduation Date:</b> June 2012<br>

	   	<b>Why Dentistry?</b>  I loved the way my teeth changed not only my confidence but my facial structure 
		and I knew that I wanted to help people feel the way I did. Another inspiration was Dr. Doug Jackson
		who came to a career fair at my high school and introduced me to the field of dentistry! Thanks!  <br>

		<b>Favorite experience regarding dentistry?</b>  Job shadowing my orthodontist, waxing and drilling teeth at the dental dept. 
		of the UWSOD, observing oral surgery, and any time I was able to observe dentistry has always been very fascinating to me. <br>

		<b>Area of specialty?</b>  Orthodontics or Oral and maxillofacial surgery <br> 

		<b>Random Fact?</b>  I absolutely love video games especially guitar hero and any of the GTA's.<br>
